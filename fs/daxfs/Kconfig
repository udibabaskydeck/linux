	help
	  A simple read-only filesystem stored in shared physical memory,
	  designed for fast container rootfs sharing between multikernel
	  instances.

	  The host kernel creates a daxfs image using mkdaxfs and writes
	  it to shared memory. The spawn kernel mounts it directly from
	  the physical memory region.

	  If unsure, say N.
